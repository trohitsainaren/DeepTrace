## 🎯 Overview

DeepTrace is a comprehensive Zero-Trust Insider Threat Detection System designed to monitor, analyze, and prevent data breaches from within organizations. Built for the **VIBECODING Hackathon 2025**, it provides real-time monitoring of user activities, behavioral analysis, and automated threat response capabilities.



# 🚨 The Critical Security Challenge

Modern enterprises face a growing insider threat crisis:

- 📊 **73%** of organizations experienced insider threats in the past year  
- 💸 **Average cost** of insider threats: **$15.38 million** per incident  
- 🧱 Traditional security focuses on **external threats**, missing internal risks  
- 👀 No visibility into **employee data handling and access patterns**  
- 🧯 Reactive approach – damage is **already done** when threats are discovered

- **Response**: High severity alert generated, event logged with user context  
- **Dashboard**: Real-time notification appears with full forensic details  

## 🕓 Scenario 2: After-Hours File Access
- **Trigger**: Developer accesses financial documents at 2 AM  
- **Detection**: Time-based rule flags unusual access time  
- **Response**: Medium severity alert with behavioral risk scoring  
- **Dashboard**: Activity logged with timestamp and risk assessment  

## 📁 Scenario 3: Document Fingerprinting
- **Trigger**: User downloads proposal document with embedded doc-id  
- **Detection**: Document fingerprint tracked across all subsequent activities  
- **Response**: Complete audit trail of document lifecycle  
- **Dashboard**: Source attribution and sharing history visible
